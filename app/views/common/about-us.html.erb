  <h1>Who we are</h1>

  <p>
    We are two guys with one idea: to cover all nooks of the world with highly segmented travel guides. Lonely Planet,
    the leading travel guide publisher, has 600+ destinations. We want to have 600,000! Megalomaniacal? No, just
    crowd-sourced web 2.0.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Guiderer?</h2>

  <p>
    Guiderer is here to tell travellers what they should be doing right now. And later on for dinner. And to night. Take
    Miami for Animals: Since it is a Monday and it is raining, consider some salsa classes. After lunch at Renzo´s Subs,
    check out the freaks on Melrose St., the tattoo street. Concise, chewed, and secretive travel tips designed your
    style of travel.

  <h2>Where did we get the idea for Guiderer?</h2>

  <p>
    Web 2.0 changed tourism. Sites like Tripadvisor and VirtualTourist made it possible for anyone to recommend or rate
    a place. Everything has been going well, except for one fact: such travel sites polarize travel recommendations,
    making the bigger establishment, or the ones with an active marketing department, more noticed. All of a sudden,
    hidden little gems have given way to the big brand restaurants, tourist bars and main attractions. The end result is
    a lot of reviews on “Buddy Guy´s Legend Blues Bar” and few on “Mamma Rosa´s blues bar”, when both are of equal
    importance to the blues-loving customers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other angle we noticed is this: a travel attraction is not ideal for everyone, but for specific market segments.
    That means that “Zizi´s Art Gallery” may be a great attraction to culture vultures, but maybe not to the traditional
    frat-boy. Stereo-typing? Pigeon-holeing? Maybe. But then again, you are on vacation, you don´t have time to
    hit-or-miss. A travel guide designed for a specific segment is bound to have tips that appeal. If the travel guide
    creator thinks Zizi´s has an appeal to frat-boys, she´ll put it in.
